# The World Cinema Randomiser
## The Context
I like to watch old and obscure movies in multiple languages. You can often find hidden gem movies that are quite unknown, the hard part is finding them. 
That's where the World Cinema Randomiser comes in. The website uses the TMDB API to request movies with certain parameters. These parameters can be randomised 
giving you quite a unique selection of movies.

## How to use

When the page launches the default is that all possible parameters (except date) are randomised. If you press the button, you'll receive a list of movies in a random language, 
random genre and random sort. If you want to only randomise one parameter then simply select a choice from the other parameters and leave that one "random".

## What I'd like to add

This was built for a 24 hour hackathon, so there are some changes that I was not able to add in the time frame. here are some:

- Minimum vote count
- Randomise button next to each parameter
- Randomise the date parameter
